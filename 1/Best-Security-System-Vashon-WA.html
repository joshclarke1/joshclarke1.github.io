The response hinges on a number of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you mean to store and for how long you plan to keep documented video. The footage is going to eat up storage space quickly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video when you reach the system's capability, however if you're not careful, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>

Another area where Arlo excels is customer service.
