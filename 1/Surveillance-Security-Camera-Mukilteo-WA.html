<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, scams, and theft. Suggestion: Frequently keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed.

<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
