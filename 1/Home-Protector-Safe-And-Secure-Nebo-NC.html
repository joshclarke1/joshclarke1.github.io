In 1997, for example, a top-ranking cops official in Washington, DC was captured using police databases to gather information on customers of a gay club.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers understand that the economical customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
