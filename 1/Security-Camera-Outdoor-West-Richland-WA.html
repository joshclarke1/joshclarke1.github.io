How did they do it? They put five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their newest software and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't state which gadget was the very first, and the last to fall, however.</p>

If you have a big home, you will require a system that has a long reception variety and can handle a more considerable amount of information and signals.
