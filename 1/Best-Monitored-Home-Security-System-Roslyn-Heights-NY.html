How did they do it? They put 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their latest software and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't state which gadget was the first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
<p>Among the first choices that you'll need to make is if you require a wireless or wired security camera system, and the proper response most likely depends upon where you plan to place the cameras and components.

On the other hand, if running wires isn't realistic, you'll enjoy the adaptability that Wi-Fi and wireless cameras use. All these considerations will affect what system you ultimately pick. For instance, if you need to record high-definition surveillance video over extended periods, bandwidth is a consideration.</p>
