Normally, consumer-grade cameras are built to work well when there is lots of readily available light, and once the lighting becomes low or missing (believe sundown or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show. Because they have bigger internal video sensors and higher-quality components that can adjust and catch outstanding low light video, commercial cameras outshine their more affordable cousins.</p>

It's an attractive feature as it can eliminate the cost of month-to-month storage charges.
