The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to resolve information after the fact, which indicates that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it likewise brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are large and use up a great deal of tape-recording storage space. A lot, in reality, that they require about 4 times the hard drive area of 1080p to tape-record the very same length of video footage.
