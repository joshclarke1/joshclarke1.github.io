<p>The genuine reason cameras are normally deployed is to minimize much pettier crimes. However it has not even been shown that they can do that.

"When the crime and offence figures were gotten used to take account of the basic downward pattern in criminal activities and offenses," criminologists discovered in one study, "decreases were kept in mind in particular categories but there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had reduced crime overall in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Office also found that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the worry of crime (as had a 2002 research study, likewise for the British federal government).</p>
