<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, scams, and vandalism. Suggestion: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one method of removing costly incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it instantly turn off the heating systems. You can automatically make the wise lights turn on to frighten away possible intruders if the motion sensing units are activated.</p>
<p>Relying on the zone activated, number and series of zones, time of day, and other aspects, the alarm monitoring center might automatically start different actions. Central station operators might be instructed to call emergency situation services immediately, or to initially call the safeguarded facilities or home supervisor to attempt to identify if the alarm is genuine. Operators could also begin calling a list of contact number provided by the customer to contact somebody to go look at the protected premises. Some zones may trigger a call to the local heating oil company to go examine the system, or a call to the owner with details of which space may be getting flooded. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be immediately displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention taped.</p>
