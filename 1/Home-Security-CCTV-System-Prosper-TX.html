As with any security system, the more equipment you include, the pricier it gets. When you include clever cameras to any Blue system, and that rate jumps a lot.

<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter occasion alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
