<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are three times more likely to be robbed. With decades of experience monitoring and setting up video and audio security systems for Seattle companies and homes, we have actually developed great relationships with both local police forces and their consumers. Also, do not forget that your wireless network security can be in some cases weak, and prone to exploits.

<p>Want to add a flood sensing unit? A clever door lock? Your system can serve as a center for up to 119 clever home gadgets, and can be managed through Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple TELEVISION, and more. IP cameras can also be linked to what is referred to as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and offers power to it.

If the system worked any other way, it would false alarm every time you walked into a protected room.</p>
