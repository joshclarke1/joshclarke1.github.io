<p>Most home security systems involve Do It Yourself installation of surveillance equipment, so I make certain that that's a simple procedure. I observe the procedure and make sure that the rate isn't too high if a home security company only offers expert installation. Professional home security installation tends to skew upwards of $100, but it's really your choice whether or not it deserves its large cost.
