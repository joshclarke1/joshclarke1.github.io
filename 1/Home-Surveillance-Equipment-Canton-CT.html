<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, accommodating innovative clever home enthusiasts or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I checked, including clever things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. However the Secure is expensive, additional sensors are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of smoke alarm or camera backups-- is likewise costly if you do not commit to a three-year contract.</p>
<p>Some of the home security companies profiled in this report include ADT, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Innovation, Assa Abloy, Secom, Robert Bosch, United Technologies, Godrej & Boyce, Allegion, Control4, Schneider Electric, Legrand, Comcast, and Vivint.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
