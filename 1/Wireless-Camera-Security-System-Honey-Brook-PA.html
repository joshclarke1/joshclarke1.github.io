<p>What PTZ cameras lack in hardiness, they make up for in versatility. They are one of the most adaptive types of security cameras and the supreme IP camera, these pan-tilt-zoom" cameras can be re-aimed remotely. They can track a person or a car throughout a range, or be programmed to cycle through different orientations to provide you a a lot more comprehensive field of view with a single piece of hardware. They can also focus and zoom in on faces or license plates in real time. They're remarkably helpful as NVR cameras, since they can react to user inputs even from off-site network connections.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
