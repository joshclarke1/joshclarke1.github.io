However, an exception can be made for home security systems that feature advantages like the ADT Mover's Cost savings Package, which permit you to take your equipment to a new home. This also depends upon the provider, but you can expect signing a contract with companies who require professional installation of their systems. The average length of a home security contract is 36 months or 3 years. On the higher end, some agreements could cover as much as 60 months or 5 years.

Here is what this suggests, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
