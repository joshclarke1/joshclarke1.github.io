The first guard showed up early so he might look at the entire location and talk with me about my concerns. He was expert, very comforting and considerate. The 2nd guard arrived in the middle of the night and took over. When I got here in the morning to get the event started, he was also expert, polite and encouraging. We were extremely happy with your service and I will advise that we contact your company next year for this occasion. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. I didn't fret once after leaving our home in your hands.</p>
