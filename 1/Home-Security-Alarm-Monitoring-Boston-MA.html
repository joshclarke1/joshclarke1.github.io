<p>GO2 supplies full-service Video Surveillance Installation of hd (HD), IP, digital, outdoor, and wireless Security Camera Systems. Naturally, the obvious downside to a wired security system is that the initial install can be costly. If the system was not set up during the homebuilding process, setting one up might need drilling holes into walls, running new wires, covering drywall and getting to difficult areas that are sealed in basements or attics. Wired security systems are also susceptible to power failures. Most will have a backup battery system that turns on in case of a blackout, but long term failures will lead to the system losing power. It's also important to think about for how long you prepare to stay at the very same home when picking a wired system. They are not portable and can't move with you since these security systems are incorporated into the home's circuitry.</p>

Unfortunately, during 2002 a Maryland professor discovered some drawbacks citation required Over the next few years these shortcomings were resolved with using TLS and other enhancements. 26 This new variation of EAP is now called Prolonged EAP and is readily available in numerous versions; these include: EAP-MD5, PEAPv0, PEAPv1, EAP-MSCHAPv2, LEAP, EAP-FAST, EAP-TLS, EAP-SIM, mschapv2, and eap-ttls.</p>

<p>When your video cameras are installed, you can choose whether or not your cameras will be monitored by the main station. If you choose to have your cameras monitored (this is generally provided for cameras that are monitoring outdoor areas), then yes, central station operators will see the video that is taped when an alarm is triggered.

The same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much photo details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
