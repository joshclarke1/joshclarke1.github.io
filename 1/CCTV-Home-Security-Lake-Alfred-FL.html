<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by method of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you need additional cable televisions. DVR systems are tough to scale up due to the fact that as soon as every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you need to buy an entirely new DVR prior to adding another camera to the system. DVRs also need that the linked cameras remain in close distance to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>
