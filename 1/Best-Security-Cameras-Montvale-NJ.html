<p>Discover how to design, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and lower crime. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensor to be touchy, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
