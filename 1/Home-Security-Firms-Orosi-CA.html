<p>The Nest Camera IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the very same subscription model and exact same app as the initial Nest Cam Outdoor, however it adds in more-detailed person detection, a brighter image, an automated close-up tracking function (which follows a person around the seeing location), much better audio, a more powerful mount, and a larger operating temperature level variety (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit).
