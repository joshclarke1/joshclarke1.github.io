<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
