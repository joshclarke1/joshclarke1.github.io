<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, vandalism, and fraud. Recommendation: Frequently keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must again respond to the alarm; each response is billed. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of removing expensive incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a certain level, you can make it automatically switch off the heating unit. If the motion sensing units are triggered, you can instantly make the wise lights turn on to frighten possible intruders.</p>
