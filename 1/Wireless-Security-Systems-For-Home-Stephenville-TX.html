Home automation is easy and hassle-free, and wireless systems help you automate your home that a lot easier.

<p>Motion sensors provide backup protection in case a burglar handles to get into your home. But they just operate when you run out the house.

<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests potential offenders are less likely to dedicate criminal offense if they think they are being enjoyed or have a higher risk of being nabbed. This is also referred to as the rational option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime avoidance technique, which argues that opportunities to anger can be decreased by altering a range of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a wrongdoer being collared, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal activity, reducing rewards from crime commission, and minimizing provocations that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>Frequently a wired system can be confused with local alarms. However, the two are drastically different. The primary distinction is that the wired system pairs with the other smart home gadgets to develop a network of home security around your home. It can be controlled remotely through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile device or through the control board (also called the alarm panel).
