<p>Because it's more complex than it should be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, signals, and combination all require different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

<p>For an outdoor camera that does more than record video and send out informs, make sure it deals with other smart gadgets.
