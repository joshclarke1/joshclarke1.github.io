Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
