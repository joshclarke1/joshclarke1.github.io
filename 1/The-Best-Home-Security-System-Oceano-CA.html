<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we might point them at the very same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually set up on the patio by a certified electrician (who happens to be my other half). All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside your home (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>

<p>Given that the glass housing does not obstruct, they aren't quite as vandal-proof as dome cameras, but they make up for it in abilities. In addition to being fantastic for re-positioning on the fly, they are much better for low-light and infrared since the glass housing doesn't hinder the lens. With some, it's tough to tell at a glimpse where they have actually been aimed, so they can provide a panoptic impression as a deterrent, despite their real field of view. Installing a video surveillance system with a few of these is a great alternative for a number of different configurations.</p>
<p>We required guards for our annual Coats for the Cold event to protect the line tent and structure, keep order in the wee hours of the early morning and to begin the heating system at 5am. The very first guard showed up early so he might look at the entire area and speak to me about my concerns. He was professional, very encouraging and courteous. The second guard arrived in the middle of the night and took control of. When I arrived in the early morning to get the event started, he was also expert, comforting and polite.
