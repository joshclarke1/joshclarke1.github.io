<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed looks and face recognition software. The latter allows you to see exactly when a specific person reaches your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. However Netatmo has expanded its security variety with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof doors and window sensing units called Tags (₤ 89.99).
