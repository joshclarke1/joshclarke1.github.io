This system is what interacts with all of the security sensing units and smart-home elements in your house. Many link to a home router, but if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular assistance, placement is more versatile.

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts every time you walk by.
