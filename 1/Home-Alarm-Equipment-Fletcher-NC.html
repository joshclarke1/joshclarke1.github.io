Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
