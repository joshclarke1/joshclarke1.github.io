The Ring Base Station lets you link Ring Alarm components so that you can monitor them through the Ring App. The Ring Base Station likewise integrates with Alexa-enabled gadgets.

However, you do require to sign up for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated.
