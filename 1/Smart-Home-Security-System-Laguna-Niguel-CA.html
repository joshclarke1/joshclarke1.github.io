We 'd be comfortable outfitting our own homes with any of them-- although each excels in a specific area. ADT provides remarkable brand recognition (a powerful criminal activity deterrent), Vivint aces home automation, and Frontpoint provides a high-support choice for those who desire a streamlined, Do It Yourself system.</p>
