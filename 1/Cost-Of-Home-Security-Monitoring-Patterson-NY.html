<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
