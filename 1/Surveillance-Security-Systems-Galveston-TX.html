Convenience is the significant reason people change to wireless," states Du, and it's hard to argue against a 10-minute setup when the wired alternative needs expert installation of wires underneath your house.

Today's systems can be modified and expanded as necessary. There are numerous alternatives for night vision cameras at your disposal. Most of them are economical yet highly practical. If you're looking for night vision cameras that provide the brightest and best night view, go for designs that leverage infrared (IR) technology. Some designs are designed to activate the IR technology automatically depending upon the light conditions. Additionally, guarantee the camera has 100 feet of night vision or more.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
