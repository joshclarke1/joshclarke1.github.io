<p>Analog high definition cameras are an excellent choice for businesses to upgrade from analog CCTV that has actually already been wired using coax cable or CAT-5 cable television. AHD cameras use the exact same RG59 or RG6 cable television as traditional CCTV cameras. CAT-5 cable with video baluns can also be used. While professional monitoring costs more, it's more secure. When something activates your alarm, your monitoring company will get the alert and then inform the authorities for you. Appears like a more secure bet to us.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
