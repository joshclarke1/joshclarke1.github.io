<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
