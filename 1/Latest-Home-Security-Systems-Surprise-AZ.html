<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle however profound changes to the character of our public areas. When residents are being viewed by the authorities - or conscious they might be enjoyed at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has explained, "knowing that you are being enjoyed by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You do not want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals might find out to be mindful about the periodicals and books they check out in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers. They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang druggies, hookers or members." Undoubtedly, the research studies of cameras in Britain discovered that individuals deemed to be "out of time and place" with the environments underwent prolonged surveillance.</p>

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
