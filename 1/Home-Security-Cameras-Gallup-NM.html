<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. When it found any type of interference, SimpliSafe responded with a declaration stating the system would alert users.

Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to replicate the problem. Although our testing shouldn't be taken as definitive, our company believe this issue is not likely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe customers who own the existing system.</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the maker's stats given that this originates from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the greatest culprit for brief battery life by far.
