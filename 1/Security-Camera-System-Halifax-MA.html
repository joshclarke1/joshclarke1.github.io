<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. SimpliSafe responded with a statement stating the system would signal users when it detected any kind of disturbance. The company likewise questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be an ideal storm of scenarios for somebody to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to reproduce the concern.
