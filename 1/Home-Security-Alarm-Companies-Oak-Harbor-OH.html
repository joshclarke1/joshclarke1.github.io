<p>While every property owner frets about burglaries, suspicion has surrounded home security systems due to their generally high expenses, complex agreements with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. ELERTS is a free mobile phone app that enables residents who see something suspicious to take a picture and rapidly send it to public safety officials. For example, a public transit rider might notice someone behaving suspiciously. Many people are fiddling, surfing or texting with their mobile devices. With ELERTS, a user can discretely snap a picture of the suspicious activity and send it to security authorities with a few clicks. Reports from mobile phone users can be rapidly evaluated and acted on by Public Safety officials.</p>

(You need to play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, canines howl, felines shriek, infants cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
