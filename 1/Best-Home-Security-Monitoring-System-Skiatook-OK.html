It makes no sense that we don't have equivalent laws for video recording.

Z-Wave and Zigbee are some of the more common wireless innovations utilized by major security companies. Here are a couple of things wireless systems provide over traditional hardwired systems.</p>

If you wish to view a large location, you need to consider a camera with a really wide field of view. The ability to mechanically tilt the camera and pan is an excellent asset as well.</p>

<p>On the surface, these two camera classifications might appear similar, though if you had the ability to see within, the distinctions end up being obvious and distinct.

Normally, consumer-grade cameras are developed to work well when there is lots of available light, and as soon as the lighting becomes low or missing (think sundown or nighttime), their pedigree begins to show. Since they have larger internal video sensors and higher-quality components that can adjust and capture outstanding low light video, commercial cameras exceed their cheaper cousins.</p>
