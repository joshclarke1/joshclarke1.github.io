<p>Our alarm systems might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge a violation. As soon as a zone has actually been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. As soon as the signal is received, the intruder alarm will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
