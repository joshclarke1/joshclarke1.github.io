<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical since the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
