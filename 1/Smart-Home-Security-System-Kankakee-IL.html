The camera's seeing angle figures out just how much space the camera will cover. Wide-angle lenses reduce the number of cameras needed to monitor your home. Some outdoor security cameras have a wide-angle lens that may show a 360-degree view, but the best security cameras have a view of a minimum of 100 degrees or much better. After checking out the talk about this page I went to Armorax's website to see what they used; they've partnered with another security company and their starter plan I think starts at $0 down.

On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>
