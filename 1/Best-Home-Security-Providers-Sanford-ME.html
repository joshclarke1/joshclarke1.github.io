However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will allow the camera to correctly find motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That also conserves battery life, but it may leave you with taping gaps during essential security events. If home security is your primary issue, we 'd advise among our top choices, however the Arlo is great for checking in on household and animals-- or roaming felines sliding around your lawn.</p>
