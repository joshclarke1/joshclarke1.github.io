We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for one of our top areas. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape-record up to 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, however entries were frequently missing, regardless of showing up in the app's activity timeline.
