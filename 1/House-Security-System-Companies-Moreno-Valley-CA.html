<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, the majority of burglar alarms work the exact very same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electric current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>

Once a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. As soon as the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
