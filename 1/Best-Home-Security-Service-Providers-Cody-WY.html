<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
