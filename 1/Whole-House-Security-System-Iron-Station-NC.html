<p>Discover how to create, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and lower criminal offense. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensor to be touchy, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was faulty, and so we may revisit this review.
