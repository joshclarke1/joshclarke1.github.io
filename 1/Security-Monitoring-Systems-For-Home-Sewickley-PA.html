Some people might state that we should not have surveillance cameras in public locations. They declare that they attack personal privacy. The argument here, nevertheless, is why be out in public if you want privacy? Surveillance cameras are suggested to keep you and other residential or commercial property safe, not to stalk you.

<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. SimpliSafe responded with a declaration stating the system would signal users when it found any kind of disturbance.

Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to reproduce the issue. Although our testing should not be taken as conclusive, we believe this problem is unlikely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe customers who own the existing system.</p>
<p>What lots of people do not recognize is that there is another class of security camera that is straight readily available to the general public, though not discovered in the huge box and discount store.

Look at the ceiling of customer electronics shops and warehouse chains and you will see in each aisle a white dome camera that is larger than the average customer camera.
