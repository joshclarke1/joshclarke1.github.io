<p>4G Wireless works comparable to a cell phone. The modem links to the internet much like a mobile phone. One of the things to consider with this choice is not just is a sim card required but likewise a cellular modem and a switch would require to be encased in an enclosure if the camera is positioned outside, this is assuming there is a close-by power supply if not a solar panel would be required. Likewise remember there would be a regular monthly charge for using a 4G network comparable to internet, if you don't foot the bill the cameras would have no signal.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
