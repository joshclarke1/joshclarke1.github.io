<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against vandalism, theft, and fraud. Idea: Typically keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We need to once again respond to the alarm; each action is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of eliminating pricey incorrect alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a specific level, you can make it immediately shut off the heater.
