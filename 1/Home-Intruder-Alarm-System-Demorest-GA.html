<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security bundle, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must carry a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer thefts throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious. However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to police ability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by authorities and entire communities (all taxpayers fund cops response to alarmed homes) a expensive and inefficient  approach to break-in reduction throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
