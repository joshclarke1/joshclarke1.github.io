As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
