<p>Because it's more complicated than it should be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

If extended video storage is crucial, be prepared to invest more cash.</p>
