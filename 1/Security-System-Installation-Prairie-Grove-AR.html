<p>The implicit justification for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks. But suicide assaulters are plainly not prevented by camera - and may even be drawn in to the tv protection cameras can make sure - and the cost of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget - far surpasses the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or tried attacks after the truth (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>Each plan provides distinct benefits. The Secure strategy is the most cost-effective package and is perfect for landline homes since it's hardwired into existing telephone connections.Whereas the Smart strategy lets you from another location arm and disarm your system, which is useful if you choose to access your system using mobile applications.
