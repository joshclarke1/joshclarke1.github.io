The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
