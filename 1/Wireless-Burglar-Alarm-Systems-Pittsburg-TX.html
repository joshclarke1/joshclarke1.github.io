Although some companies supply free or greatly reduced hardware in exchange for a service dedication that can last anywhere from one to five years, we discovered no-contract systems to be the most flexible.

Your alarm company should be certified, pay any registration or false alarm charges, and provide physical proof like camera video or a broken window to require authorities response.</p>
