<p>We enjoy that the Argus 2 features a color night vision choice, but the black and white variation can really be clearer and give you higher-quality video. This isn't really a big offer thinking about the Argus 2's rate and all its other features-- however for the record, stick with black and white. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo smart service. But the coolest feature is that you can charge it with the assistance of solar power with a solar panel charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
