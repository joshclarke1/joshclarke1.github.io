<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, scams, and vandalism. Recommendation: Frequently keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset.

<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
