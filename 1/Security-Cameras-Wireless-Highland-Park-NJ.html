<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the exact very same method. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the alarm system. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
