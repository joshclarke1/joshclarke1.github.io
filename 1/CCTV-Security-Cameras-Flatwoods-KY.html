Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The response depends upon a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you intend to store and for how long you prepare to keep taped footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to consume storage area rapidly.

There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR.
