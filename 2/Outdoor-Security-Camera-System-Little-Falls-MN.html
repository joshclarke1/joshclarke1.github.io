<p>We still think the Ring Alarm is a fantastic option for a cheap home security system with smart home assistance. However possibly avoid the cameras in the meantime. Hard drive storage is safe, secure, and convenient, with many systems using expansion and complimentary cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera store to an SD card, which you'll need to by hand remove to transfer the information? Does it go to your mobile phone, or upload to services like Dropbox?

Wireless systems are also ideal for occupants due to the fact that they don't need opening the wall, and can easily be taken with you when you relocate to your next location. If you're seeking to boost your apartment's security, or simply want to watch on your place while you're out, think about setting up a portable wireless security system.</p>
