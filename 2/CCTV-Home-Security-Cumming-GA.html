<p>ADT's monitoring centers offer protection with the latest technological equipment 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. ADT engineers test the company's cameras, entranceway contacts, high-decibel alarms, and smoke alarms under challenging conditions-including severe cold and heat, as well as circumstances where there might be radio disturbance.

(We think this is a more valuable feature if you're placing the Circle 2 outside, where cars and trucks often pass.)
