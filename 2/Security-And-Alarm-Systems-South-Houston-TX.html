<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal since the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers realize that the economical customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera.

DVRs also need that the linked cameras be in close distance to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to degrade.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on developed to resolve the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly selected words) makes pre-shared essential WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption schemes, any client in the network that understands the secrets can check out all the traffic.</p>

You can also use MPEG4, however the quality tends to be lower than that of MPEG4's abovementioned equivalents. Compression techniques are relatively complicated and differ in their applications depending upon your needs and hardware.
