<p>When your video cameras are set up, you can choose whether or not your cameras will be monitored by the main station. If you select to have your cameras monitored (this is usually provided for cameras that are monitoring outdoor areas), then yes, main station operators will see the video that is tape-recorded when an alarm is set off. However, you might choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is typically provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, houses). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any factor, even if asked for by the consumer.</p>
<p>I have actually covered customer electronics for more than 15 years and have actually evaluated scores of smart-home devices, from remotes and security cameras to AV receivers and speakers. As a former editor for Electronic House and Broad View Big Noise, I've composed purchasing guides for numerous consumer-electronics items, and I've written posts covering innovation for The New York Times (which is now Wirecutter's moms and dad company), Wired, Female's Day, Guy's Health, and other publications.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
