<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for one of our top areas. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape approximately 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were often missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline.

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency.
