<p>The Canary is among the largest cameras we tested, and it uses two-way interaction with its paid Canary Subscription. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our screening. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces.
