<h3>Smart Home Security Monitoring in Mississippi</h3>
<p>Since it's more complicated than it should be, we don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, signals, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style rules.

Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features.
