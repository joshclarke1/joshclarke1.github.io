<p>The real reason cameras are usually deployed is to reduce much pettier crimes. However it has actually not even been shown that they can do that.

"When the crime and offence figures were gotten used to appraise the general downward trend in criminal offenses and offenses," criminologists discovered in one research study, "decreases were noted in particular categories but there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had reduced criminal offense overall in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office likewise discovered that cameras did not cut criminal offense or the fear of criminal offense (as had a 2002 research study, likewise for the British government).</p>
