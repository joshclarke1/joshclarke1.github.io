"When the crime and offence figures were gotten used to take account of the general downward trend in criminal activities and offences," criminologists found in one study, "reductions were noted in particular classifications but there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had actually decreased criminal offense overall in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Home Office likewise discovered that cameras did not cut crime or the fear of criminal activity (as had a 2002 study, also for the British government).</p>
