<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, vandalism, and fraud. Tip: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We should once again respond to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of eliminating expensive incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a particular level, you can make it automatically shut off the heating unit. You can instantly make the smart lights turn on to frighten away possible robbers if the motion sensors are set off.</p>
