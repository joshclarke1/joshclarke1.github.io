<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides free advantages like person detection, familiar-face informs, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage starts at $5 each month.) However, in our tests the familiar-face signals worked just about 50 percent of the time and the camera consistently detached from the network numerous times a day (when everything else on our network seemed fine).
