<p>We enjoy that the Argus 2 features a color night vision option, however the black and white version can in fact be clearer and provide you higher-quality footage. This isn't actually a big deal considering the Argus 2's price and all its other features-- but for the record, stick with black and white. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo clever service. But the coolest feature is that you can charge it with the aid of solar power with a solar panel charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
