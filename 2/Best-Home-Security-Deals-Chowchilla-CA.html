You can set the siren to follow up within 30 to 180 seconds to ideally terrify off any trespassers. Confirmation calls from Rapid Action, a third-party partner service, came within one minute of our 113-decibel siren (per our measurements) being set off; you can disarm it by using the app or by giving your personally selected safe word to customer care The base station likewise informed us when it was detached from power, and it provided on its pledge of 24 hr of battery backup.</p>
