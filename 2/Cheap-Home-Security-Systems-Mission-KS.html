<p>B. This chapter governs alarm system systems meant to summon authorities department personnel, needs registration, assessment of fees for extreme incorrect burglar alarms, supplies treatments for repeat transgressors, and offers an effective date. While some vestiges of the old market remain, today's homeowners are presented with a lot more choices.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
