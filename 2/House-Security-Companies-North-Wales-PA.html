This chapter governs alarm system systems intended to summon police department workers, needs registration, evaluation of charges for extreme false burglar alarms, supplies procedures for repeat culprits, and offers an effective date.

On the other hand, a professional monitoring company will contact authorities if a house owner can't validate a false alarm. If  cops are contacted for a false alarm, house owners might have to pay a fine for dispatching police needlessly. A self-monitored home limitations the potential for false alarms and subsequent penalties.</p>
