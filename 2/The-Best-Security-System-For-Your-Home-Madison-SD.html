<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone entering the shop.
