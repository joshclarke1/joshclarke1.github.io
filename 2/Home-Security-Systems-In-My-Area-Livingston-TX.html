Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you plan to store and how long you plan to keep documented video footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to consume storage space rapidly.
