<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, scams, and vandalism. Suggestion: Frequently keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We should again respond to the alarm; each action is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one method of getting rid of pricey incorrect alarms.

<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration stating the system would notify users when it detected any kind of interference.

Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the problem.
