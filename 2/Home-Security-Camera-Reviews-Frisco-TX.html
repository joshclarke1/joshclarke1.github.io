<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 services, universities, and government facilities, and residential consumers. After researching 4 different security systems, we decided on SSA. They provided us the best description of their services and provided us more for the money.

We've been testing Ring Alarm quite a bit lately, and we really like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security kit that offers basic intrusion protection with super-low regular monthly monitoring charges. Or ... no monitoring costs at all if you pick the free self-monitor" option.</p>

You can be sure that it will be steep, however, coupled with the mandatory 3-year contract and monthly professional monitoring fee. Ring makes a variety of popular video doorbells, however the company faces unpleasant personal privacy concerns over its questionable data-sharing collaborations with police companies. And, according to reports, countless Ring consumers just recently had their account information exposed. We do not recommend any of the company's products at this moment.</p>
<p>Installation is a personal choice. Nevertheless, numerous systems are simple to install and don't require any electrical wiring. Some do not even require mounting equipment. Include a glass break detector. Window sensors don't safeguard against somebody smashing through big glass windows or sliding glass doors and strolling through it.
