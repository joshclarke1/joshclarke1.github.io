But I also value minimalist systems that parts that carry out more than one action, like Minut. Some parts can make home automation readily available to you. Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, wise lock, and so on), I want to make certain that they all easily interact with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
