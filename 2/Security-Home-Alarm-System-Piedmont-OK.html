The offers of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers cast doubt on the suitability of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or 4 free incorrect alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they supply no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and typically over long distances.

In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for more electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, normally via 110VAC power.</p>
