<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical because the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
