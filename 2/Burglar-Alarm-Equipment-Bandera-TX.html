Nevertheless, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it likewise brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are large and take up a great deal of recording storage space.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
