Wyze's recently introduced Total Motion Capture fixes this issue for $1.50 per month per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly starts another, without any spaces in between.
