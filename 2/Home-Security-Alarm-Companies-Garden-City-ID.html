The Wyze Camera can also capture video to the cloud, however the totally free account is limited to 12-second clips every 5 minutes. That suggests the camera will wait 5 minutes before it's able to tape again, which indicates you may be missing a lot. Wyze's recently introduced Total Motion Capture fixes this issue for $1.50 per month per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly starts another, without any spaces in between.
