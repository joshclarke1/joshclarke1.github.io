<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
<h3>Burglar Alarm Equipment Hilmar CA 95324</h3>
