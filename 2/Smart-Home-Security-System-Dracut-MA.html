Keep an eye on what matters by streaming your security camera on your TELEVISION using Google Nest or Home speaker or display and Chromecast or a TV with Chromecast built-in.</p>
<p>If an employee (trusted entity) brings in a wireless router and plugs it into an unsecured switchport, the whole network can be exposed to anybody within series of the signals.

However, there are effective countermeasures (like disabling open switchports during switch configuration and VLAN setup to restrict network access) that are readily available to protect both the network and the information it includes, but such countermeasures must be used evenly to all network devices.</p>
