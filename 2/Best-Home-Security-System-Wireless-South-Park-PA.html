The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies bring into question the appropriateness of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or four free false alarms per fiscal year, since they offer no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
