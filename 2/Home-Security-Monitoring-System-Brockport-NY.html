Given that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to by hand stop notifications (and recording, given that it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connection problems, with 2 Hive test units detaching eight times over 2 months. Scout is extremely easy to utilize, especially if you're a fan of mobile devices.

This isn't actually a big offer considering the Argus 2's price and all its other features-- but for the record, stick with white and black. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo smart service. But the coolest function is that you can charge it with the help of solar power with a solar panel charger.</p>
