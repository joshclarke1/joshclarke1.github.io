Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you plan to store and for how long you prepare to keep recorded video footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video is going to eat up storage area quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video footage as soon as you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not cautious, the system might overwrite archived video that you still need.</p>

Wired security systems are linked by hard-wired cable televisions and need access to power outlets, making them more difficult to place and install.

In spite of the substantial rate here, there's no external monitoring alternative.</p>
