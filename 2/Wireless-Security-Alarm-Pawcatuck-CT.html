<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment this way to make clients stick with them longer, because switching monitoring companies indicates hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for customers. How did they do it? They put five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their latest software application and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't say which gadget was the very first, and the last to fall, though.</p>

Central station operators might be instructed to call emergency situation services right away, or to initially call the secured premises or property manager to attempt to determine if the alarm is real. Operators might likewise start calling a list of contact number supplied by the client to call someone to go look at the protected facilities. Some zones might activate a call to the local heating oil company to go look at the system, or a call to the owner with information of which space might be getting flooded.
