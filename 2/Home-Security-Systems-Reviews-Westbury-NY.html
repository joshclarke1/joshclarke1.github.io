I put this wireless CCTV camera type top of the list just because if you don't know it, you will lose huge. Intelligent technology understands the difference. With clever sensors, you and your pet can stay safeguarded without fear of false alarms. It is much better to have a separate computer (server) for publishing video to the cloud.

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider location and therefore offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
