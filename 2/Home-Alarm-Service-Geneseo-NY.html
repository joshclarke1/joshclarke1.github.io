<p>B. This chapter governs alarm system systems planned to summon police department personnel, requires registration, assessment of fees for extreme incorrect alarm system, offers procedures for repeat offenders, and provides an efficient date. While some vestiges of the old industry stay, today's property owners are presented with a lot more choices.
