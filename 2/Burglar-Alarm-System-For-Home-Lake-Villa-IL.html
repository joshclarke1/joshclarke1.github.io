Throughout screening, we discovered it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly triggering when motion was found. We love that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll require several Minuts throughout your property, which can get expensive. It's likewise worth keeping in mind that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it just monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.
