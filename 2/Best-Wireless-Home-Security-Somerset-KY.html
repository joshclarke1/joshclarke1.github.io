By searching for the license plate varieties of parking area at the club and looking into the backgrounds of the vehicles' owners, he tried to blackmail patrons who were married. Envision what somebody like that might do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal because the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients understand that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
