<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a fantastic security camera and a phenomenal worth. It receives an Outstanding rating for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to store video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership plans for extra cloud storage.
