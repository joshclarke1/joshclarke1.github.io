We love that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just alerts you when motion is created by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no incorrect signals). Nevertheless, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have additional sensing units and essential fobs, too.</p>
