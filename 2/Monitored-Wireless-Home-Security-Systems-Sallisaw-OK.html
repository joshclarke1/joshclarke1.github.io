<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to strive to make a camera with the most hard setup understood to man. Here's how it plays out: First you need to put and download the app in your email address. Then you enter the WiFi details of the network you're attempting to link to. Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi info. (You should play this at complete volume or it will not work). Windows smash, pets growl, felines shriek, babies weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first ten seconds.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
