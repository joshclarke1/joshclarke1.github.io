<p>Most home security systems involve DIY installation of surveillance equipment, so I ensure that that's an easy process. I observe the process and make sure that the cost isn't too high if a home security company just provides professional installation.

<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the hub) is $399, and extra cameras are $299 each. The Arlo Ultra doesn't come with a totally free tier of cloud storage, so you have to spend a minimum of $3 per month if you wish to save any videos. And if you want to save 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera monthly, on top of the month-to-month plan, the latter of which is waived for the first year. But if you desire the absolute best when it comes to video quality, the Arlo Ultra has it.</p>
