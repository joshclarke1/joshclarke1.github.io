<p>Cross-zoning is a technique that does not require a new keypad. Utilizing numerous sensors to monitor activity in one area, software application analyses input from all the sources. For instance, if a motion detector journeys in one area, the signal is tape-recorded and the central-station monitor informs the customer. A second alarm signal-- gotten in a nearby zone within a brief time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor needs to ask for a dispatch right away. This integrates in increased protection and a fail safe should a door blow open or a bird rattle an exterior window.</p>
