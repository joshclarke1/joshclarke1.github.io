<p>Though most of our attention these days is focused on the shift to IP video technology, it is very important to note that analog CCTV security cameras can still be extremely efficient for lots of surveillance applications, especially those on a budget. With traditional CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and transferred in analog format for local viewing from one central monitoring place.

Utilizing IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to take advantage of your existing analog cameras while migrating into the world of digital surveillance.</p>

<p>An outdoor camera is perfect for watching on what's occurring beyond your home. These devices are weatherproof and normally require a nearby GFCI (ground fault circuit interrupter) outlet to provide power, although there are a handful of battery-powered models out there. Just like their indoor counterparts, outdoor cameras connect to your Wi-Fi network and permit you to view live video from your phone. They are fairly easy to install, however if you're not familiar or comfortable with electrical wiring, you may want to have a professional electrical contractor get the job done.</p>
<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, due to the fact that it is rather connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder before buying.</p>
