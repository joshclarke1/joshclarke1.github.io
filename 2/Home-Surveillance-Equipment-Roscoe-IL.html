<p>Honeywell's DIY security system relies on a gadget called the Camera Base Station. It's an Amazon Echo-like device with a camera on top. It acts as the brains of the system, connecting with sensors and third party-devices through Z-Wave and controlling them using the app or voice control. Another area where Arlo excels is customer support. After long-lasting screening this camera since we initially made it a pick in 2016, we discovered that our Arlo Q started forecasting a pink tint, which appears to be an ongoing problem for some owners. We called client support, which offered a free replacement system-- although the guarantee had long since expired.</p>
