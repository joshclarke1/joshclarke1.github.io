<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, dealing with innovative smart home fanatics or fans of a particular ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I tested, including clever things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.

<p>The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is one of the most expensive home security cameras around, but it's also one of the smartest, too.

<p>That potential defect aside, the Arlo Q provided sharp and colorful 130-degree video and still images, in both intense and dim light, even when utilizing the 8 x digital zoom. The night mode produced exceptionally crisp images, but they didn't look as bright as the Logitech Circle 2's. However, using the SimpliSafe mobile app requires a paid monitoring strategy. You can include service month-by-month or each year.
