As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "understanding that you are being watched by armed government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You don't wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "individuals might learn to be careful about the regulars and books they check out in public, preventing titles that may alarm hidden observers.
