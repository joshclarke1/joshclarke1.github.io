<p>Finally, the Police Department and the Town regularly get demands to waive incorrect alarm costs. By ordinance, only incorrect alarms caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquake or other devastating events, are subject to appeal. Alarms activated by electrical storms, thunder, hail, or sudden modifications in temperature level do not meet the requirements for waiver of false alarm costs. Alarms activated by legal but unexpected entry to the residential or commercial property, i.e. kids returning home, guests, neighbors caring for the home while you are on getaway and delivery males do not satisfy the standard for waiver.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular because the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers understand that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
