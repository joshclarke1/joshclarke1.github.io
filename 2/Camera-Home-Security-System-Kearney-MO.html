Rather, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts each time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
