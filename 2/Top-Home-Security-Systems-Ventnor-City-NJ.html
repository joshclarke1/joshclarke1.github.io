<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
