<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technically sophisticated outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking feature, which instantly zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of vision.

The alarm does not consist of a wifi security camera however you can buy a variety of various Yale cameras that will deal with the alarm as optional bonus. There's no external monitoring alternative with this alarm.</p>
