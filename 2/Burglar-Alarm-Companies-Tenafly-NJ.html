Or ... no monitoring costs at all if you pick the free self-monitor" option.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technically sophisticated outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking feature, which instantly zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom.

The alarm does not consist of a wifi security camera however you can buy a variety of various Yale cameras that will deal with the alarm as optional bonus. There's no external monitoring alternative with this alarm.</p>

We 'd most likely recommend a company like Vivint, ADT, or Frontpoint if you're beginning from scratch.</p>
