<p>Reliability has actually long been at the heart of the argument over wireless versus hardwired home security systems.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
