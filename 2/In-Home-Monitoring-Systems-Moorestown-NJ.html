<h3>Wireless Home Security Camera Systems in New Jersey</h3>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers realize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
