<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, vandalism, and fraud. Idea: Frequently keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We should again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
