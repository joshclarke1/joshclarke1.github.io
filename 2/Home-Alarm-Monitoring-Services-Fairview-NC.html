<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, should provide at least a number of months of operation on a charge (depending on use). The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of complimentary cloud storage (with more readily available for a monthly fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will permit the camera to effectively identify motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That also saves battery life, but it may leave you with tape-recording gaps throughout important security events. If home security is your primary concern, we 'd suggest among our top choices, but the Arlo is excellent for signing in on household and family pets-- or roaming cats slipping around your lawn.</p>
