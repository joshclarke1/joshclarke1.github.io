<h3>Home Security Systems Reviews in North Carolina</h3>
<p>Among IP security alternatives, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send data over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the footage from anywhere. A common misconception is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then connects to the internet and a router. Finally, wire-free cameras are completely cable television free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are needed, these are the most convenient alternative to install and all of the recorded footage is kept in the cloud.</p>
