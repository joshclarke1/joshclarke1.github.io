Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
