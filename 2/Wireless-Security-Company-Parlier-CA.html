<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, theft, and fraud. Tip: Frequently keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must again react to the alarm; each response is billed. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one method of removing pricey false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a specific level, you can make it immediately turn off the heating unit.
