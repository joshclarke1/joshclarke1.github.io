<p>Studies show surveillance cameras minimize criminal activity. HD CCTV systems are compatible with standard analog CCTV cameras. If you purchased cameras prior to 2010 or if you have coax cable television (look at the cable behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable box) in your existing security system that means you have conventional analog CCTV security cameras.
